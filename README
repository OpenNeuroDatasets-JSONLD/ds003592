Neurocognitive aging data release with behavioral, structural, and multi-echo functional MRI measures

Data included as part of: Functional architecture of the aging brain (preprint:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437922v1)


Two 10-minute multi-echo resting-state runs were collected from 301 healthy adults (181 younger, 120 older adults) across 2 sites. Acquisition parameters are summarized below. Full detail can be found in the above preprint and forthcoming data descriptor.

A subset of 246 participants also have T2-FLAIR images. Pulse and respiration data are available for 233 participants.

**NOTE** Some participants were included as part of another openneuro dataset (DuPre et al, 2018; OpenNeuro Accession Number: ds000210), as noted by 'openneuro' in the participants file.

Accompany behavioral data can be found on OSF: https://osf.io/yhzxe/
